# 🔧 Payment & Webhook Troubleshooting Guide

## 🚨 Current Issue
The webhook is not being triggered because **the payment was not completed successfully**. The database shows no payments, which means the payment process failed before Stripe could send a webhook.

## 📋 Step-by-Step Solution

### 1. ✅ Complete the Payment First
You need to actually complete the payment in `stripe-payment-test.html`:

1. **Open** `stripe-payment-test.html` in your browser
2. **Enter** the client secret: `pi_3SDSe2Lje7aworqD3aMMw8pO_secret_rbGBw3Da0GD7rxD0XfuV4lRrp`
3. **Use test card details:**
   - Card Number: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Expiry: Any future date (e.g., `12/25`)
   - CVC: Any 3 digits (e.g., `123`)
   - Name: Any name
4. **Click** "Confirm Payment"
5. **Wait** for success message

### 2. 🔍 Monitor Server Logs
Keep Terminal#1-21 (or terminal 17) open to watch for these messages:
```
🔔 WEBHOOK RECEIVED: {timestamp, headers, bodySize}
✅ Webhook signature verified successfully
📨 Received webhook event: payment_intent.succeeded
💰 Processing payment succeeded
✅ Successfully processed payment_intent.succeeded
```

### 3. 🎯 Expected Flow
```
Payment Completion → Stripe Webhook → Server Processing → Database Update
```
